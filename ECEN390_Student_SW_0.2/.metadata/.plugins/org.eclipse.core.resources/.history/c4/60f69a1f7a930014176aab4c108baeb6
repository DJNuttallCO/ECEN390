// at the beginning because filter_computePower() requires more time when starting up (has to perform all mult-accs).
// After testing, it was found that it was not possible to efficiently run the timer ISR faster than 100 kHz. As such,
// you can't affort to have any states as everything has to complete in a single tick.
